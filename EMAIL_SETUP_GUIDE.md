## How to Set Up Email Integration for Your Contact Form

Your contact form is now ready to receive emails directly to your inbox! Follow these steps to complete the setup:

### Step 1: Get Your Web3Forms Access Key

1. **Go to Web3Forms**: Visit [https://web3forms.com](https://web3forms.com)

2. **Create an Account**: 
   - Click "Get Started" or "Sign Up"
   - Enter your email address (use the email where you want to receive form submissions)
   - Create a password

3. **Verify Your Email**: Check your email and click the verification link

4. **Get Your Access Key**: 
   - After verification, you'll be redirected to your dashboard
   - You'll see your unique Access Key (it looks like: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`)
   - Copy this access key

### Step 2: Update Your Contact Form

1. **Open your Contact.jsx file**
2. **Find these two lines** and replace `YOUR_ACTUAL_ACCESS_KEY_HERE` with your actual access key:
   ```jsx
   formData.append("access_key", "YOUR_ACTUAL_ACCESS_KEY_HERE");
   ```
   and
   ```jsx
   <input type="hidden" name="access_key" value="YOUR_ACTUAL_ACCESS_KEY_HERE" />
   ```

3. **Example**: If your access key is `abc123-def456-ghi789`, it should look like:
   ```jsx
   formData.append("access_key", "abc123-def456-ghi789");
   ```

### Step 3: Test Your Form

1. **Start your development server**: `npm run dev`
